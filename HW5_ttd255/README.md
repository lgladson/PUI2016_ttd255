##Assignment 3: Practice formulating the null hypothesis 

Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

###- Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise? 

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Null Hypothesis: The fat loss of the test sample (who are on diet) is less or equal to the fat loss of the control sample

H0: %fat loss of test sample >= %fat loss of the control sample

###- Do American trust the president?

POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23).
Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

Null Hypothesis: American do not trust the president.

H0: Percentage of the whole American population answered yes is close to 0.
(The probability of observing 45% people answered yes in one sample needs to be higher than the significant level for the null hypothesis to be accepted).

###- Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking. 

Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

Null Hypothesis: Nicotine patches do not have effect on smoking quitting

H0: The cessation rate of smoker using nicotine patch <= The cessation rate of smoker using placebo patch

###- Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. 

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

Null Hypothesis: Smoking has negative influence on pregnant women.

H0: The IQ of the children, whose mothers smoked when they were pregnant is lower than the IQ of the children, whose mothers did not smoke when they were pregnant on average at each age 1, 2, 3, 4.
