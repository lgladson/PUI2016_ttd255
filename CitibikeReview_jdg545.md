Looking at the Null Hypothesis, the english formulation is correct but the formula is inverted. The Null Hypothesis posits that the ratio of men nighttime biking to men daytime biking is the same or lower than women nighttime biking to women daytime biking. However, the formula shows the opposite.

The data collected supports the project since it shows bike trips by start time and by gender. However, the bike trips should be grouped into nighttime and daytime in order to compare them appropriately.

I would recommend a t-test as a statistical hypothesis to compare the differences between men's and women's riding habits. The t-test would work well because there are two groups.
